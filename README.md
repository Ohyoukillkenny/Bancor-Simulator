### We build a simulator of Bancor, which helps to explain the difference between Bancor market and real-world market.

## Configuration

1. Python 2.7 + Anaconda 2.7.
2. PyQT4 and Linux Operating System required for running the GUI


## How to run
### Here we give three ways to view how Bancor protocol works.

1. *Recommended*, run **New-Bancor-Simulator.ipynb** in ipython notebook, then follow the comments.
2. *For Results*, run **BancorGUI.py** or **BancorGUI-noAlpha.py** in file QT, by inputting parameters to GUI. (Old Version)
3. Run **main.py** in python. The customers.py presents the python class for customer simulating, the smartToken.py is the python class for smartToken in Bancor market, which includes the Bancor protocol.

## Other documents

1. **Figures** file contains figures and results of simulating.
2. **QT** file contains GUI codes for Bancor simulator as well as figures and txt file which tracks information in simulating.
