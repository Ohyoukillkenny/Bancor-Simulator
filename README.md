### We build a simulator of Bancor, which helps to explain the difference between Bancor market and Classic market.

## Configuration

Python 2.7 + Anaconda 2.7

## How to run
### Here we give three ways to view how Bancor protocol works.

1. Run **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py** in python. The **customers.py** presents the python class for customer simulating. The **smartToken.py** is the python class for smartToken in Bancor market, which includes the Bancor protocol. And the **market.py** is the python class for Bancor Market and Classic Market simulating.
2. If you want to get experiment results as quickly as you can, just run **Bancor-CN.py, Bancor-R.py, …, Classic-CN.py, …, Classic-TE.py**. These files are used to launch control experiment. Results are recorded in sub-files in Figure/Bancor or Figure/Classic.

## Other documents

1. **Figures** file contains figures generated by **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py**, which record the experiment results.
2. **Result** file contains temporary text results generated by **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py**.
