### We build a simulator of Bancor, which helps to explain the difference between Bancor market and Classic market.

## Configuration

Python 2.7 + Anaconda 2.7

## How to run
### Here we give three ways to view how Bancor protocol works.

1. *Recommended*, run **Bancor-Simulator.ipynb** in ipython notebook, then follow the comments.
2. Run **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py** in python. The **customers.py** presents the python class for customer simulating. The **smartToken.py** is the python class for smartToken in Bancor market, which includes the Bancor protocol. And the **market.py** is the python class for Bancor Market and Classic Market simulating.

## Other documents

1. **Figures** file contains figures generated by **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py**, which record the experiment results.
2. **Result** file contains temporary text results generated by **main-Bancor.py** and **main-Classic.py**.
3. **Result.pdf** contains all details about this simulator. And it analyzes the experiment results.
4. **difference-allin-halfin** file contains an instance customers' money under a specific parameter setting.
