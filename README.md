### We build a simulator of Bancor, which helps to explain the difference between Bancor market and real-world market.

## How to run

1. *RECOMMENDED*, run *Bancor-Simulating.ipynb* in ipython notebook, then follow the comments.
2. Run *marketsimulator.py* in python. The customers.py presents the python class for customer simulating, the smartToken.py is the python class for smartToken in Bancor market, which includes the Bancor protocol.

## Other documents

1. *Failure* file contains figures about failure rate of transaction.
2. *Price* file contains figures about the shifting price of the Smarttoken with the time.
3. *Transaction-Record.txt* records the information of smarkToken during transactions.
4. *gaussian.py* and *gaussian-price.ipynb* is just the test for gaussian function. Please ignore them.
